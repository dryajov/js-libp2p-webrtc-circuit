> A WebRTC transport built for libp2p (not mandatory to use with libp2p) that uses existing circuit relay connections to negotiate a WebRTC connection. This should allow leveraging existing circuit relays, including those running in browser nodes.

## Example

```JavaScript
TODO
```

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
> npm install libp2p-webrtc-circuit
```

### API

Follows the interface defined by `interface-transport`

### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees. If you would like to know more about why we did this, see the discussion at this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/362).

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```JavaScript
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
